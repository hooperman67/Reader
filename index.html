Maeda was sent off in the 23rd minute, and Rodgers decided against making any substitutions until half-time despite being down to 10 men. Instead, the Northern Irishman employed a 4-3-2 formation with Luis Palma and Kyogo Furuhashi up front for the Bhoys.

Celtic currently sit bottom in Group E, having earned just one point after four games. With just two matches remaining, they face an uphill battle for a chance to advance to the knockout stages.
