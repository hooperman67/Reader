 Not one for saying ‘I predicted it’ (Except I am, constantly) but.....I predicted it. 


I would be very surprised if we signed Jordan Larsson. Seems so unlikely and based on nothing but the idea that it would be ‘pure class’ but if it happens I will never doubt a Scottish tabloid ever again.— Stevie ⚪️ (@stevieblock102) July 8, 2022



Many got a bit carried away with the initial speculation a few days ago, and that’s really all it was until it was confirmed his agent had stated Celtic were seriously interested in the striker, who is available on a free transfer. 
However, Anthony “R” Joseph delivered a knockout blow not so long ago. 


UPDATE: It&#x27;s looking increasingly unlikely that Celtic will offer a contract to forward Jordan Larsson. His reps made contact with the Hoops - as well as a number of clubs, including Nottingham Forest.Larsson weighing up options with interest from England, Germany &amp; Italy. https://t.co/Pvgpwar191— Anthony Joseph (@AnthonyRJoseph) July 11, 2022



As expected, it’s almost certain Larsson will not follow in his fathers footsteps and become a Celtic legend, and instead try his luck at one of the bigger leagues in Europe, which was always going to be the case for a player of his quality.
So to cheer you up if that’s knocked you for six, here’s Metallica x Celtic to get you going for the season ahead:
