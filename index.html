 It’s been far from Swiss Bliss for Albian Ajeti at Celtic, but his departure from the club could be imminent, if reports from Football Scotland are to be believed. 
Here’s the actual article: 
Albian Ajeti’s future at Celtic could be resolved in the coming weeks.
Ange Postecoglou has admitted that he expects there to be some ‘movement’ in the coming weeks while providing an update on the Swiss striker. Ajeti has failed to impress since joining Celtic from West Ham United in 2020 after arriving in a £5million deal from the English Premier League side.
The 25-year-old has scored 9 goals in 49 appearances for the Parkhead side but he’s barely featured since Postecoglou’s arrival. He played 17 times last season but the majority of those games were cameos from the bench as he struggled with a hamstring injury, sustained against Real Betis in the Europa League. Ajeti didn’t travel to Poland last week with the Hoops squad for the friendly against Legia Warsaw in Artur Boruc’s testimonial.
The quotes from Ange are what you’ll mainly be interested in though.
The Celtic boss said: “Ajeti has had a bit of a knee problem but he trained in Glasgow while we are in Poland last week. We’ll see what happens. There’s still time in this window and there will be some movement.”
The highlight of Ajeti’s time here has probably been the goal at Tannadice in the ‘covidball season’, in a game that many fans noticed we were in bother for the campaign ahead, despite his later winner.

It’s been a rather unsuccessful spell for the player and a move away would be beneficial for him, and Celtic. Hopefully a permanent transfer can be sorted out in the next few weeks.</span>

 Ahead of the return of a famous sporting organisation getting ready for THE REAL STUFF on Sunday, we thought we’d take a look back and share some season openers over the years.
But enough about GIGPOD, Celtic are also going to be kicking a ball. 
With the actual football just around the corner, here’s a few curtain raisers we’ve enjoyed over the years, either at Celtic Park, or away from home!
We start with a classic at Tannadice in 1991. Dundee Utd 3-4 Celtic, featuring two absolute screamers from John Collins!

Sunday’s opponents were also involved in a memorable 2-2 draw back in August 1996. This was a game that I went to in an era when I missed no away games, but to this day, it’s one of only three games I have left before the 90 minutes are up, and indeed I never witnessed Thom’s leveller below.

Does it get any better than the win at Tannadice in 2000, for what was the first game of the MON era though?

A decade of opening day dominance after that, generally, other than the occasional away day draw, including this disasterclass in 2005 against Motherwell at Fir Park!

We all remember Patrick McCourt’s virtuoso effort at Inverness in 2010 surely?

Fast forward six years later, Tynecastle 2016. Scott Sinclair’s late winner starts the invincible run under Brendan Rodgers

And while the Neil Lennon regime was hardly inspirational, there was of course the fantastic 7-0 thumping of St Johnstone back in 2019!

Let’s hope for more of the same this weekend!
Here’s some trivia to leave you very confident for the game ahead:


Trawled through records to find out when was the last time we lost a game at Celtic Park on the opening day of the season and it seems to have been; 9th Sep 1950 - Celtic 3-4 Morton. Pub quiz obsessives, you’re welcome!— Stevie ⚪️ (@stevieblock102) July 26, 2022</span>

 Yesterday was, thankfully, the last pre season game we’ll be involved in before regular blogs during the season that will be 22-23, and it’s Aberdeen at Celtic Park next weekend.

Reaction to the comfortable victory was covered on 67HH too!

Earlier tonight, we had rumours (and that’s all they are) developing regarding Michael Johnston being SHIPPED OUT on loan to Ronald Deila’s Standard Liege.

Would definitely be the best thing for his career, and well within Celtic’s interests to see him getting regular games at another club, so hopefully this isn’t yet another lie from a Twitter account and it actually has a bit of weight to it in the coming days.</span>
