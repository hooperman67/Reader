                              <span>Brendan Rodgers believes league officials can do more to assist teams facing potential fixture congestion. For instance, Celtic&#x27;s Champions League group stage opponents, Atletico Madrid, have only one game scheduled on Friday against Las Palmas between next week&#x27;s Group E tie. In comparison Celtic face St Mirren tonight at Celtic Park and Ross County away in Dingwall on Saturday ahead of next Tuesday&#x27;s clash against Atletico.
