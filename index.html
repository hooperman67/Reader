 So tomorrow - the well documented game that we won’t be able to watch legally in the draconian backwater that is Scotland.
Let’s be honest, this country is crap. From the state of our city centres decaying and overpriced, the trains literally never running on time - ever - and the way football fans are treated here, it’s genuinely a surprise we even bother.
We put up with it all for Celtic, somehow.
It’s back to Dingwall tomorrow and here’s our predicted XI: 
Hart
Juranovic
Welsh
CCV
Taylor
McGregor
O’Riley
Turnbull
Maeda
Kyogo
Jota.

We did say on GIGPOD that we’d have Ralston in for JJ, Jota on the left and Abada for Maeda, with Hatate injured, it means David Turnbull slots back in and can prove his worth to the side.
67HailHail did a video earlier today previewing the game in depth:

 It’s fair to say it’s been a slow week at Celtic after Sunday’s win. 
The news coming out of the club has been generally non existent and we’re sure that’ll not be the case when we’re playing in the CL and the League cup onwards at the end of this month, alongside being in league duty too. 
Ange’s presser ahead of Saturday’s game - a 3pm blackout of course - at Ross County will be tomorrow afternoon although we’re not sure what fan media will be representing at that one alongside the usual press lot. 
Either way, it’ll be interesting to hear Ange after he was less than impressed on Sunday with our sloppiness at times during the game, and of course if he’s going to be rotating the team.
In the meantime, weird reports appeared last night and this morning that Tom Rogic was linking up with Neil Lennon in Cyprus, following his decision to leave Celtic in May.
