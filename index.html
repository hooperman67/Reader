 Well, it’s a midfielder we’re linked with again, albeit another attacking one and not the defensive king. 
Indeed, reports suggest Celtic are interested in Barcelona’s Alex Collado.

There may very well be ‘something’ to this, but let’s not get too excited and go ‘all in’ on it like we did with that Vinicius Souza nonsense, only to all get disappointed and in some cases, a few people looked really stupid.
Furthermore, it would suggest Ange is keen to add more creativity to the squad, and may very well not be fully happy with the current attacking players in the side.
Here’s some stats on Collado:
