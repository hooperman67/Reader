If you missed the goals, check them below

Hamish and John did a reaction to the win shortly after the game also.

Stevie and Reidzo will be on GIGPOD duties tomorrow so expect an episode dropping later in the evening in what will be episode 124, mainly covering the performance, Jota and a good old fashioned battering of a Derek McInnes side!</span>
