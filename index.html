                              <span>Tottenham Hotspur made a fantastic start to the season under the management of Ange Postecoglou.

                              <span>After Celtic drew 1-1 against Motherwell, the Rangers were handed a major chance to get back into the title race. All they needed to do was win their games in hand and they would be just three points behind the Hoops in the league table. We have seen the Ibrox side not perform at their […]
