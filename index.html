                              <span>European dream officially over 


  It was always going to be a long shot to keep the Europa League dream alive. However, Celtic’s 1-1 stalemate with Shakhtar Donetsk confirmed that Ange Postecoglou’s men will not be playing in any European competition after Christmas. Already knocked out of the Champions League with two games remaining in the groups, the Hoops did still have an outside chance of reaching the last-32 of the Europa League. They had to beat Shakhtar and then Real Madrid in Spain, mind you, so not exactly the easiest of tasks. It wasn’t to be though as the Hoops were held to a draw by the Ukrainian outfit. It was another good performance by Postecoglou’s side. They’ll be sure to learn from the experience ahead of next year.</span>
