 The main news from Celtic Park today was the unsurprising exit of Boli Bolingoli, the man who caused grown men to put his surname on their twitter display names back in 2019. 


      I Boli Bolingoli tekende voor twee seizoenen en komt de linkerflank van KVM versterken ❤️Meer info  https://t.co/GtKClzCuaH#trotsoponzekleuren #Boliisnekakker— KV Mechelen (@kvmechelen) July 12, 2022



The left back joined KV Mechelen earlier today in a permanent deal. 
The writing has indeed been on the wall for the much maligned Belgian, who incurred the wrath of Neil Lennon, the entire support and of course the wonderful Scottish Government in August 2020 after THAT flight to Spain. 


Celtic boss Neil Lennon says there’s been no explaination from Boli Bolingoli about why he flew to Spain for an overnight. “I’m absolutely livid, it’s a total betrayal of trust” pic.twitter.com/eLZivwB35w— Clyde 1 Superscoreboard (@ClydeSSB) August 11, 2020



Nicola Sturgeon even gave Scottish Football the dreaded yellow card!

He infamously made an appearance in the brutal 1-0 loss at the Anthony Macaroni last season too! 


Guess who is back for Celtic Boli Bolingoli has been handed a surprise start by Ange Postecoglou, can he take the chance against Livingston? ⬇️⬇️⬇️ https://t.co/u6Ae876Qjc pic.twitter.com/X1VfmtO1Gb— Daily Record Sport (@Record_Sport) September 19, 2021



Then weighed in with an assist for David Turnbull’s screamer against Motherwell at Fir Park. 
Here’s the goals from that game:

He came, he worked a lot of people into a shoot and he left.
Boli Bolingoli, thank you for your service and all the best, I suppose.
