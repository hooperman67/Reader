 It’s been far from Swiss Bliss for Albian Ajeti at Celtic, but his departure from the club could be imminent, if reports from Football Scotland are to be believed. 
Here’s the actual article: 
Albian Ajeti’s future at Celtic could be resolved in the coming weeks.
Ange Postecoglou has admitted that he expects there to be some ‘movement’ in the coming weeks while providing an update on the Swiss striker. Ajeti has failed to impress since joining Celtic from West Ham United in 2020 after arriving in a £5million deal from the English Premier League side.
The 25-year-old has scored 9 goals in 49 appearances for the Parkhead side but he’s barely featured since Postecoglou’s arrival. He played 17 times last season but the majority of those games were cameos from the bench as he struggled with a hamstring injury, sustained against Real Betis in the Europa League. Ajeti didn’t travel to Poland last week with the Hoops squad for the friendly against Legia Warsaw in Artur Boruc’s testimonial.
The quotes from Ange are what you’ll mainly be interested in though.
The Celtic boss said: “Ajeti has had a bit of a knee problem but he trained in Glasgow while we are in Poland last week. We’ll see what happens. There’s still time in this window and there will be some movement.”
The highlight of Ajeti’s time here has probably been the goal at Tannadice in the ‘covidball season’, in a game that many fans noticed we were in bother for the campaign ahead, despite his later winner.

It’s been a rather unsuccessful spell for the player and a move away would be beneficial for him, and Celtic. Hopefully a permanent transfer can be sorted out in the next few weeks.</span>
