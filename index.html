  The Premiership season may only be four games in, but Celtic have a slender lead at the top of the table. The Hoops maintained their perfect start to the campaign by earning all three points against Hearts. It wasn’t all their own way, with the Jambos by far and away the third best team in the country, but it was an important result all the same. As much as it’s only two points, the champions now boast an early lead over Rangers in the title race. The teams will meet in two weeks’ time at Parkhead in the first derby match of the season. You can bet that Ange Postecoglou will be eying up the chance to extend that advantage heading into September.</span>
