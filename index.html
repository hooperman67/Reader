                              <span>THE third season of Tommy Burns’ turbulent time in charge of Celtic ended abruptly when he was fired. The Scottish Cup semi-final replay exit against First Division Falkirk on April 23 1997 brought down the curtain on the fans’ favourite dug-out involvement just before the completion of an explosive, topsy-turvy 1996/97 campaign. Burns had returned [...]</span>

The American made a somewhat unexpected return to the pitch, as Brendan Rodgers started him in the final pre-season friendly against Athletic Bilbao. Carter-Vickers might not have played a game in months, […]
