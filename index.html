                              <span>Michael Beale seemed to have a habit of creating controversy with his comments during his less than a-year-long run as the manager of the Rangers. Much like too many of his results in the Glasgow Derby, he appears to have come out on the wrong end when it comes to his back-and-forth comments with one […]
