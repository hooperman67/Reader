  It was always going to be a long shot to keep the Europa League dream alive.

They had to beat Shakhtar and then Real Madrid in Spain, mind you, so not exactly the easiest of tasks. It wasn’t to be though as the Hoops were held to a draw by the Ukrainian outfit. It was another good performance by Postecoglou’s side. They’ll be sure to learn from the experience ahead of next year.]]></summary>
