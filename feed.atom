EXCLUSIVE! Sead Haksabanovic jets in for Celtic transfer as champions also eye a new midfielder | @ScottBurns75 https://t.co/tQBD78h34t pic.twitter.com/dWtAbfu3xW— Daily Record Sport (@Record_Sport) August 22, 2022

It comes after the hoops went top of the league after a routine but boring 2-0 win over Hearts at Celtic Park.

GIGPOD 125 has been recorded, and we’ve had a right good laugh at Robert ‘Robbie’ Neilson among looking forward to this weeks CL draw, so in the meantime enjoy the 67 Hail Hail post match reaction from ‘Babbers’]]></summary>
