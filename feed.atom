 Mortiz Jenz and Aaron Mooy, as widely expected a few days ago, officially put pen to paper for the club earlier today.
Australian internationalist, Mooy, is reunited with his former manager, having worked under Ange Postecoglou during his tenure with the national team, and he joins the club on a two-year deal. Moritz Jenz is a German central defender who has been playing in the French top flight with Lorient since 2021.
Prior to that, the 23-year-old spent five years with Fulham, after which time he had a season in Switzerland with Lausanne-Sport before moving to France. He joins Celtic on a season-long loan, with the club having an option to buy.
