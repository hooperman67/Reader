 As promised the latest GIGPOD is now out and live everywhere. You can get it on iTunes, Spotify or anywhere else you listen to your podcasts!


 NEW PODCAST ⚪️ GIGPOD EP 125: CELTIC CHEERS, HEARTS TEARS Reidzo & Stevie discuss: John’s PROTEST, JJ back to his best, Neilson’s whining and a MOCK champions league draw Spotify: https://t.co/nSPxAo4jFg& everywhere else!  pic.twitter.com/zzGPxLDN4p— GIGPOD ⚪️ (@gigpod) August 23, 2022



Check it out for Reidzo’s very exciting Saturday tale about going to Braehead, spending nothing, meeting a fan and then catching the last ten minutes of the game at Easter Road. It really is riveting stuff.
Elsewhere, we said goodbye, officially this time, to Chris Jullien.

The big defender joined Montpellier on a permanent deal earlier this evening.

All the best to him for his contribution to the club since his arrival in 2019, as well as his big goals against Lazio, Rangers and - believe it or not - Hamilton! 
Here’s all his goals for us!]]></summary>

  The Premiership season may only be four games in, but Celtic have a slender lead at the top of the table. The Hoops maintained their perfect start to the campaign by earning all three points against Hearts. It wasn’t all their own way, with the Jambos by far and away the third best team in the country, but it was an important result all the same. As much as it’s only two points, the champions now boast an early lead over Rangers in the title race. The teams will meet in two weeks’ time at Parkhead in the first derby match of the season. You can bet that Ange Postecoglou will be eying up the chance to extend that advantage heading into September.]]></summary>
