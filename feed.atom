 If you were under a rock yesterday, or asleep listening to the latest GIGPOD, you’ll no doubt have seen our draw for the Champions League.

The manager gave his thoughts on the group earlier


 Ange Postecoglou gives his thoughts on our Champions League Group F opposition  Real Madrid  RB Leipzig  Shakhtar DonetskEuropean Nights are back at Paradise!⭐️#UCL | @ChampionsLeague | #COYBIG pic.twitter.com/zWl9JivrEs— Celtic Football Club (@CelticFC) August 26, 2022



It’s nowhere near as bad as it could have been and there’s some winnable games in there!
We’ve beaten all of the teams we’ve been drawn with before in the past too. 
Starting with Real Madrid in 1980, although they won the return leg 3-0.

Back in 2018, KT and Eddy scored to help us to a 2-1 win over RB Leipzig

And we’ve played Shakhtar twice, in 2004 and 2007, with the latter being the most memorable fixture! 
A great video of Donati’s ‘wondergoal’ below!

Next up - Dundee United on Sunday for Ange and the team, we’ll cover that over the weekend!]]></summary>

 As promised the latest GIGPOD is now out and live everywhere. You can get it on iTunes, Spotify or anywhere else you listen to your podcasts!


 NEW PODCAST ⚪️ GIGPOD EP 125: CELTIC CHEERS, HEARTS TEARS Reidzo & Stevie discuss: John’s PROTEST, JJ back to his best, Neilson’s whining and a MOCK champions league draw Spotify: https://t.co/nSPxAo4jFg& everywhere else!  pic.twitter.com/zzGPxLDN4p— GIGPOD ⚪️ (@gigpod) August 23, 2022



Check it out for Reidzo’s very exciting Saturday tale about going to Braehead, spending nothing, meeting a fan and then catching the last ten minutes of the game at Easter Road. It really is riveting stuff.
Elsewhere, we said goodbye, officially this time, to Chris Jullien.

The big defender joined Montpellier on a permanent deal earlier this evening.

All the best to him for his contribution to the club since his arrival in 2019, as well as his big goals against Lazio, Rangers and - believe it or not - Hamilton! 
Here’s all his goals for us!]]></summary>
