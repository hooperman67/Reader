But if there is one thing to be deduced from Celtic’s four warm-up encounters to date this summer, it’s that it is unlikely to be a dull season once again under Ange Postecoglou. There were just the four goals this time as they played out a 2-2 draw with English Championship side Blackburn Rovers, first-half strikes from Jota and David Turnbull turning round an early deficit after Sam Gallagher had scored for the visitors in the opening couple of minutes. Ben Brereton-Diaz scored the leveller with 15 minutes left from a free-kick after some slack play from Yosuke Ideguchi, a slightly worrying common theme of Celtic’s games to date.

Some poor mis control in midfield by allowed Blackburn’s attackers to latch onto the ball. A lovely reverse through-ball from Jack Vale slipped in Sam Gallagher. The big striker made no mistake inside the box as he slammed home past Joe Hart. Without doubt, the sloppiness was highly unlike Celtic’s midfield and defensive players. With it being a friendly, of course it doesn’t matter in the grand scheme of things. However, there’s no denying that Postecoglou will not want to a repeat of those mistakes when the league season starts in two weeks. Celtic are always a threat going forward, but it’s also clear at they’re far too open at the back still and are therefore susceptible to losing goals against decent opposition.]]></summary>
