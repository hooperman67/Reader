        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former Celtic goalkeeper Packie Bonner hailed Celtic's character after an incredible 6-0 win against Aberdeen saw the Bhoys go eight points clear at the top of the Scottish Premiership.
Celtic dominated Aberdeen from start to finish in their biggest win of the season despite the announcement of Daizen Maeda's injury on Friday. 
Hyunjun Yang opened the scoring for Celtic just nine minutes into the game, with Kyogo Furuhashi adding another after 16 minutes. Although they had to wait just over 60 minutes for their third goal, the Bhoys were clearly the dominant side and could have won the game by an even greater margin.
