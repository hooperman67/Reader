 If you were under a rock yesterday, or asleep listening to the latest GIGPOD, you’ll no doubt have seen our draw for the Champions League.


⭐ We have been drawn in Group F of the @ChampionsLeague - Fixtures TBC #CelticFC | #UCLdraw pic.twitter.com/IfDpVHtog2— Celtic Football Club (@CelticFC) August 25, 2022




The manager gave his thoughts on the group earlier


 Ange Postecoglou gives his thoughts on our Champions League Group F opposition  Real Madrid  RB Leipzig  Shakhtar DonetskEuropean Nights are back at Paradise!⭐️#UCL | @ChampionsLeague | #COYBIG pic.twitter.com/zWl9JivrEs— Celtic Football Club (@CelticFC) August 26, 2022



It’s nowhere near as bad as it could have been and there’s some winnable games in there!
We’ve beaten all of the teams we’ve been drawn with before in the past too. 
Starting with Real Madrid in 1980, although they won the return leg 3-0.

Back in 2018, KT and Eddy scored to help us to a 2-1 win over RB Leipzig

And we’ve played Shakhtar twice, in 2004 and 2007, with the latter being the most memorable fixture! 
A great video of Donati’s ‘wondergoal’ below!

Next up - Dundee United on Sunday for Ange and the team, we’ll cover that over the weekend!]]></summary>
