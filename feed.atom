 So tomorrow - the well documented game that we won’t be able to watch legally in the draconian backwater that is Scotland.
Let’s be honest, this country is crap. From the state of our city centres decaying and overpriced, the trains literally never running on time - ever - and the way football fans are treated here, it’s genuinely a surprise we even bother.

It’s back to Dingwall tomorrow and here’s our predicted XI: 
Hart
Juranovic
Welsh
CCV
Taylor
McGregor
O’Riley
Turnbull
Maeda
Kyogo
Jota.
