          "description": "HART SHOWING WHY HE IS NUMBER ONE\n\n\n  Benjamin Siegrist moved to Celtic in the summer after being released from Dundee United, and as he signed on the dotted line at Parkhead, he confirmed that he would be giving his all to challenge Joe Hart for the No1 jersey. Going by today’s showing it certainly looks like Hart will be up for the fight after he pulled off a string of impressive saves. The former England international also showed his organisational qualities as he constantly communicated with the defence in front of him. Hart was a key performer last term, and he will need to continue to produce this season. He had a slight error in his 45-minute stint for Rapid Vienna’s first goal, but he will undoubtedly look to blame the slack back pass from Cameron Carter-Vickers.",
