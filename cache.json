          "description": "Photo by Vladimir Pesnya/Epsilon/Getty Images\n  \n\n Not one for saying ‘I predicted it’ (Except I am, constantly) but.....I predicted it. \n\n\nI would be very surprised if we signed Jordan Larsson. Seems so unlikely and based on nothing but the idea that it would be ‘pure class’ but if it happens I will never doubt a Scottish tabloid ever again.— Stevie ⚪️ (@stevieblock102) July 8, 2022\n\n\n\nMany got a bit carried away with the initial speculation a few days ago, and that’s really all it was until it was confirmed his agent had stated Celtic were seriously interested in the striker, who is available on a free transfer. \nHowever, Anthony “R” Joseph delivered a knockout blow not so long ago. \n\n\nUPDATE: It's looking increasingly unlikely that Celtic will offer a contract to forward Jordan Larsson. His reps made contact with the Hoops - as well as a number of clubs, including Nottingham Forest.Larsson weighing up options with interest from England, Germany & Italy. https://t.co/Pvgpwar191— Anthony Joseph (@AnthonyRJoseph) July 11, 2022\n\n\n\nAs expected, it’s almost certain Larsson will not follow in his fathers footsteps and become a Celtic legend, and instead try his luck at one of the bigger leagues in Europe, which was always going to be the case for a player of his quality.\nSo to cheer you up if that’s knocked you for six, here’s Metallica x Celtic to get you going for the season ahead: \n\n\n\nFor Whom The Bell Tolls & Celtic ParkTogether at last!  pic.twitter.com/b2o9SjXknd— GIGPOD ⚪️ (@gigpod) July 11, 2022",
