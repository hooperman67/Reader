The Japanese playmaker scooped the ball beyond the Shakhtar keeper after only ten-minutes as Ange Postecoglou’s men came out of the traps flying. Kyogo showed intelligence to let the ball trickle over the line as he may have been offside if he’d touched it. The Scottish champions totally dominated the opening exchanges and really should have been up by more. At this level, opposition teams clearly do have the quality to hurt you, though. So, while it was an impressive start, the Ukrainian team were allowed back into the match and they settled very well after equalising.",
