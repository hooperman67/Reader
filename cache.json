          "description": "Ringing the changes highlights squad depth \n\n\n  Ange Postecoglou opted to almost completely change the side which demolished Dundee United at the weekend. The Australian made a significant amount of changes to his starting XI for this last-16 cup tie, nine in total. The likes of Benji Siegrist, Anthony Ralston, Stephen Welsh and Alexandro Bernabei all got some vital minutes in the tank. Of course, even with the huge amount of changes, the team was still incredibly strong and well-capable of defeating every team in Scotland. Interestingly, James Forrest and James McCarthy still couldn’t break into the starting line-up despite the alternative team.",
