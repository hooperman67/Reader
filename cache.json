Going by today’s showing it certainly looks like Hart will be up for the fight after he pulled off a string of impressive saves. The former England international also showed his organisational qualities as he constantly communicated with the defence in front of him. Hart was a key performer last term, and he will need to continue to produce this season. He had a slight error in his 45-minute stint for Rapid Vienna’s first goal, but he will undoubtedly look to blame the slack back pass from Cameron Carter-Vickers.",
